# General Introduction to Project Starter Collection

## Pain Points

- The traditional "Getting Started" documentation only teaches you how to set up a simple demo app. Developers have to spend effort configuring and customizing the project before they can finally start developing features. This process repeats every time when starting a new project.
- Instead of the usual raw example, Project Starter Collection aims to provide complete starter templates for everyone to easily start your development on different frameworks.

## Core Principles

We adhere to the following principles:

- Complete Structure: Well-considered folder structure. Already-written common setup. Multi-environment support.
- Minimal: Keep it simple. Don't over-customize.
- Ready to Start: Infrasturcture-as-Code. Runnable without any modification.
- Opinionated: Functional over imperative, explicit over convention, embrace comments.
